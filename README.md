# CarPricePredictor

A machine learning project to predict car prices based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more.

## Project Overview

This project uses multiple machine learning models to predict the price of cars. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables. Feature engineering and model tuning are also performed.

## Key Files
- `main.py`: Main script for running the prediction models.
- `extract.py`: Script for data extraction and preprocessing.
- `ml.py`: Contains machine learning models and evaluation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
